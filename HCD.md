## High Concept Statement
The BallTag rolls. It's great at killing spare time, just catch the
enemy and then evade until his time runs out. Be the one who catches
the other quicker, pick power-ups to get an extra boost.

## Feature Set
-   Physics based control of a ball with the third person point of view.

-   Constrained arenas with various obstacles to use for evasion of the enemy.

-   Power-ups to help the player get an edge on the enemy, but the enemy races to destroy them so it is not so easy for the player.

-   Protection time to get and give some head start to player and the enemy.

## Team Roles
-   Design - Jiri Valasek

-   Programming - Jiri Valasek

-   Art -- Free asset hunting

## The Competition
This game is uniquely combines the racing experience with a potential
to develop your own tactics to best the enemy and without the routine
of going only left, right or straight how the track dictates. Hence,
this game found a niche although the idle game competition is broad.

## Innovation/Creativity
-   Simple tag game idea to understand.

-   Power-ups to make it more interesting.

-   Only two players with protection timeout to keep it engaging, no NPC
    catching each other while player just watches.
